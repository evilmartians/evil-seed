## [Unreleased]

### Added

 - Options to exclude all `has_many` and `has_one` or optional `belongs_to` associations by default. [@Envek]

   ```ruby
   root.exclude_has_relations
   root.exclude_optional_belongs_to
   ```

   Excluded associations can be re-included by `include` with matching pattern.

 - Exclusion and inclusion patterns can be specified as hashes and/or arrays. [@Envek]

   ```ruby
   config.root('Forum', featured: true) do |forum|
     forum.include(parent: {questions: %i[answers votes]})
   end
   ```

   Which is equivalent to:

   ```ruby
   config.root('Forum', featured: true) do |forum|
     forum.include(/\Aforum(\.parent(\.questions(\.answers))?)?)?\z/)
     forum.include(/\Aforum(\.parent(\.questions(\.votes))?)?)?\z/)
   end
   ```

 - Print reason of association exclusion or inclusion in verbose mode. [@Envek]

 - Allow to apply custom scoping to included associations. [@Envek]

   ```ruby
   config.root('Forum', featured: true) do |forum|
     forum.include('questions.answers') do
       order(created_at: :desc)
     end
   end
   ```

### Fixed

 - Bug with null foreign key to back to auxiliary `has_one` association with not matching names. E.g. user has many profiles and has one default profile, profile belongs to user.
